## Introducing Projects

Present all your projects in style with a super customizable web app! ‚ú®

`Projects` uses the GitHub API to list all your GitHub projects in a nice searchable grid.
Also shows pretty programming icons using `devicons`.

## How it was built

Projects was built using `HTML` `CSS` & `JavaScript`.
It was built on Neovim and the python http server.
Uses GitHub API for data and Devicons for programming icons.

## What I learned

- Learned about a few quirks of the fetch API, especially implementation of `maxPages`.
- Flex, box-shadow and some other CSS tricks were revisited.
